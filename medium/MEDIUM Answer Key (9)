1.Identify our new and old customers and make a new column named Customer_Status where this characteristic is identified (new customers made their accounts from 2010 and later, and old customer made their accounts before 2010)
      Select Cust_Code, Date_Opened,
      Case
      When Date_Opened < '2010%' then 'Old Customer'
      Else 'New Customer'
      End As Customer_Status
      From customer
      
      
2.Identify the balance of a customer using their Opening amount and payment amount (account for all of the null functions)
      Select Opening_AMT - IFNULL(Payment_AMt,0)
      As BALANCE_AMT
      From Customer;
      
      
3.Replace all of the dashes in the phone number column and then delete all of the information of the individuals who entered an invalid phone number or didnâ€™t enter a payment amount
      Update customer
      Set Phone_No = Replace(Phone_No, '-', '');
//Two seperate statements      
      Delete from Customer 
      where Payment_amt is null 
      OR Length(Phone_NO) != 10;
      Select * from customer;
