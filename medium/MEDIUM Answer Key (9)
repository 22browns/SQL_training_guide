1.Identify our new and old customers and make a new column named Customer_Status where this characteristic is identified (new customers made their accounts from 2010 and later, and old customer made their accounts before 2010)
      SELECT Cust_Code, Date_Opened,
      CASE
          WHEN Date_Opened < '2010%' THEN 'Old Customer'
          ELSE 'New Customer'
      END AS Customer_Status
      FROM customer;
      
      
2.Identify the balance of a customer using their Opening amount and payment amount (account for all of the null functions)
      SELECT Opening_AMT - IFNULL(Payment_AMt,0)
      AS BALANCE_AMT
      FROM Customer;
      
      
3.Replace all of the dashes in the phone number column and then delete all of the information of the individuals who entered an invalid phone number or didnâ€™t enter a payment amount
      UPDATE Customer
      SET Phone_No = Replace(Phone_No, '-', '');
//Two seperate statements      
      DELETE FROM Customer 
      WHERE Payment_amt IS NULL 
      OR Length(Phone_NO) != 10;
      
      SELECT * FROM customer;
