1.Find out how many customers each Agent acquired and order that list from largest to smallest
      SELECT COUNT(Ord_Num) AS CustomersAcquired, Agent_Code FROM Orders
      GROUP BY Agent_Code
      ORDER BY Count(Ord_Num) desc;
      
      
2.Find out which Agents had at least 3 or more orders above $1000 and order this list from smallest to largest
      SELECT COUNT(Ord_Num), Agent_Code FROM Orders
      WHERE Ord_Amount > 1000
      GROUP BY Agent_Code
      HAVING COUNT(Ord_Num) > 2
      ORDER BY COUNT(Ord_Num) asc;
      
      
3.Determine if there are any orders between the daysorder table and the order table that have the same order number but different order amounts
      SELECT Ord_Num, Ord_Amount
      FROM orders
      WHERE EXISTS(SELECT Ord_Num FROM daysorder WHERE daysorder.Ord_Num = orders.Ord_Num AND daysorder.Ord_Amount != orders.Ord_Amount)
      ORDER BY Ord_Num asc;
      
      
4.Identify the names of the customers who ordered their items during the month of July (use the orders and customer tables)
      SELECT Cust_Name
      FROM customer
      WHERE EXISTS (SELECT Cust_Code 
                  FROM orders 
                  WHERE orders.Cust_Code = customer.Cust_Code 
                  AND orders.Ord_Date like "2008-07%");
