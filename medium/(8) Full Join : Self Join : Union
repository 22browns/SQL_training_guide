For this lesson, you will learn how to join tables with Full Join, Self Join. Also, you will learn how to combine records
from different SELECT statements into one column.

Full Join and Self Join are the final two of the five join statements that are left to learn. We will follow a similar format for teaching these statements as we did 
with the rest of the Join statements. We will use the same practice dataset as before.

                                        Table 1 - Names                                              Table 2 - Salaries
                                EmployeeID             Name                                  EmployeeID              Salary
                                    1                 Amanda                                     2                   100000
                                    2                 Bill                                       3                   80000
                                    3                 Courtney                                   5                   65000
                                    4                 David                                      6                   95000
                                    5                 Eli                                        7                   80000
                                    6                 Ferguson                                   8                   130000
                                    7                 Gabriel                                    9                   140000

Remember that JOIN statement format that you should follow whenever you join tables together.
SELECT [columns] FROM [table1]
[JOIN] [table2] ON [column].[table1] = [column].[table2];

*Full Outer Join*
SELECT [columns] FROM [table1]
FULL OUTER JOIN [table2] ON [column].[table1] = [column].[table2];
  - A FULL JOIN is like doing a LEFT and RIGHT join all in one statement. 
  - The resulting table will be a combination of each table in which ALL of the records from both tables will appear.
  - Using your knowledge of JOIN statements, try writing a FULL OUTER JOIN query of the Names and Salaries tables. The output should look like the table below.
