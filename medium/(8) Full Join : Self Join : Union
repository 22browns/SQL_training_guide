                                                                    LEARNING

For this lesson, you will learn how to join tables with Full Join, Self Join. Also, you will learn how to combine records
from different SELECT statements into one column using the UNION Statement.

Full Join and Self Join are the final two of the five join statements that are left to learn. We will follow a similar format for teaching these statements as we did 
with the rest of the Join statements. We will use the same practice dataset as before.

                                        Table 1 - Names                                              Table 2 - Salaries
                                EmployeeID             Name                                  EmployeeID              Salary
                                    1                 Amanda                                     2                   100000

                                    3                 Courtney                                   5                   65000
                                    4                 David                                      6                   95000
                                    5                 Eli                                        7                   80000
                                    6                 Ferguson                                   8                   130000
                                    7                 Gabriel                                    9                   140000

Remember that JOIN statement format that you should follow whenever you join tables together.
SELECT [columns] FROM [table1]
[JOIN] [table2] ON [column].[table1] = [column].[table2];

*Full Outer Join*
SELECT [columns] FROM [table1]
FULL OUTER JOIN [table2] ON [column].[table1] = [column].[table2];
  - A FULL JOIN is like doing a LEFT and RIGHT join all in one statement. 
  - The resulting table will be a combination of each table in which ALL of the records from both tables will appear.
  - Using your knowledge of JOIN statements, try writing a FULL OUTER JOIN query of the Names and Salaries tables. The output should look like the table below.
  
                                                    EmployeeID         Name        Salary
                                                         1            Amanda      
                                                         2            Bill         100000
                                                         3            Courtney     80000
                                                         4            David        
                                                         5            Eli          65000
                                                         6            Ferguson     95000
                                                         7            Gabriel      80000
                                                         8                         130000
                                                         9                         140000
                                                         
*Self Join*
SELECT A.[column] AS [alias 1], B.[column] AS [alias 2]
FROM [table] A. [table B]
WHERE [condition]
  - Out of the 5 different types of joins, self joins are the most irregular. Instead of joining with another table, SELF JOIN will join a table with itself.
  - Lets say that you have two tables, one for employees and one for managers. In the employee table is an ID, Name, and ManagerID. In the Manager table is a ID, and Name.
    You should already know that you would be able to see the name of each employee's manager by using a LEFT JOIN on Employee.ManagerID = Manager.ID;
    Now lets say that instead of having two tables, you had one big table employee table with all members of the company that had the columns ID, EmployeeName, ManagerID
    (ManagerID would be blank for executives at the company) How would you see the boss of each employee if there is only one table? SELF JOIN. 
  - As you may have noticed, because of its irregularity, SELF JOIN is the only join that does not follow the join statement format. However, if you follow the format above, 
    the solution to the manager employee problem would look something like this
    
        SELECT A.EmployeeName AS Workers, B.EmployeeName as Managers
        FROM Employees A, Employees B 
        WHERE A.ManagerID = B.ID;
    
  - See the bottom of this page: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_self.asp for a really good example of understanding what self joins are used for and how they work.
  
*Union*
SELECT [column(s)] FROM [table1]
UNION
SELECT [column(s)] FROM [table2];
  - The UNION operator is used to combine the records of 2+ different select statements into one column.
  - If you are going to select more than 1 column, they must be listed in the same order within the query.
  - You can include WHERE clauses within any or all of the SELECT Statements.
  - A UNION operator will not return duplicate values, so if you want to allow for duplicate values, simply use the 'UNION ALL' operator.
  - Lets say you are a middle school principal with 3 different tables. A table for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. In each of these tables is a column for Name, Email, Address.
    If you wanted to obtain a list of all Emails of students at the school, you could used a union operator as such:
    
        SELECT Name, Email FROM SixthGrade
        UNION
        SELECT Name, Email FROM SeventhGrade
        UNION
        SELECT Name, Email FROM EigthGrade;
  
                                                                      PROBLEMS

1.Use SQL Union to return the customer code of the agent who has the Agent code A010 in both the customer’s table and days order table (Distinct values)



2.Use SQL Union to return the customer code of the agent who has the Agent code A010 in both the customer’s table and days order table (All values)



3.Use SQL Self join in order to match customers (A,B) from the same city



4.Use the SQL Full Join to select all customers and orders numbers
