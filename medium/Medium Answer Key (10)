1.Check if all customers in the table have a grade equal to or above 0, if so, move all customers with a grade >= 0 into a new table called customers_good
      SELECT CUST_NAME
      INTO #customers_good
      FROM customer
      WHERE GRADE = ALL 
      (SELECT GRADE FROM customers WHERE GRADE >= 0);



2.Check if any customers in the table have a grade equal to or above 3, if so, move all customers with a grade >= 3 into a new table called customers_good. 
**NOTE** SQL Lite does not support the â€œAny'' function. If you are interested in attempting this problem, utilize a different SQL server that supports full SQL not just Lite.
      SELECT CUST_NAME
      INTO #customers_good
      FROM customer
      WHERE GRADE = ANY 
      (SELECT GRADE FROM customers WHERE GRADE >= 3);
