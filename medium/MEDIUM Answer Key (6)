1.Return the customers city and country that also order from the orders table using an inner join statement (CUST_CODE)
      SELECT * FROM Orders
      INNER JOIN Customer ON Orders.CUST_CODE = (Select CUST_CODE from customer);
      
      
2.Use a left join to add Orders ON to the Customers table but only return customer name, city, and country as well as order number
      SELECT CUST_NAME, CUST_CITY, CUST_COUNTRY, Orders.ORD_NUM
      FROM Customer
      LEFT JOIN Orders
      ON orders.CUST_CODE = (select CUST_CODE from customer);
      
      
3.Use a Right join to add Customers ON to the Orders table but only return customer name, city, and country as well as order number
      //Right joins are not currently supported on SQLite
      SELECT Customer.CUST_NAME,Customer.CUST_CITY, Customer.CUST_COUNTRY, ORD_NUM
      FROM Orders
      LEFT JOIN Customer
      ON orders.CUST_CODE = (Select CUST_CODE from customer);
