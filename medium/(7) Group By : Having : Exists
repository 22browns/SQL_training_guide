                                                                    LEARNING

In this lesson, you will learn the GROUP BY, HAVING, and EXISTS Statements.

*Group By*
SELECT [AVG/SUM etc...] from [table]
GROUP BY [column name] 
  - GROUP BY is most useful when used alongside an aggregate statment such as SUM, AVG, COUNT etc..
  - What it does is it groups together records that have a matching value in the specified column.
    Next, it will perform the aggregate statements one time for each grouping, rather than once for the entire table.
  - For example, if we are in the orders table and wanted to find averages, we could Group by country to determine the average
    order cost in each country.
    
*Having*
SELECT [columns] FROM [table]
GROUP BY [column(s)] HAVING [aggregate function condition]
  - HAVING is used in place of a where statement. This is because a where statement can not be used with an aggregate statement.
    i.e WHERE AVG(ORD_AMOUNT) > 50; This statement will not run on any SQL software; however, the following will
    HAVING AVG(ORD_AMOUNT) > 50;
    
*Exists*
SELECT [columns] FROM [table]
WHERE EXISTS([subquery]);
  - What the exists operator does is check to see if any records from the original select statement match
    any records that are returned by the subquery.

1.Find out how many customers each Agent acquired and order that list from largest to smallest



2.Find out which Agents had at least 3 or more orders above $2000 and order this list from smallest to largest



3.Determine if there are any orders between the daysorder table and the order table that have the same order number but different order amounts



4.Identify the names of the customers who ordered their items during the month of February (use the orders and customer tables)
