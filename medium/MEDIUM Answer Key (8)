1.Use SQL Union to return the customer codes of the agent who has the Agent code A010 in both the customer’s table and days order table (Distinct values)
      SELECT Cust_Code, Agent_Code FROM Customer
      WHERE Agent_Code = 'A010'
      UNION
      SELECT Cust_Code, Agent_Code FROM daysorder
      WHERE Agent_Code = 'A010'
      ORDER BY Cust_Code;
      
      
2.Use SQL Union to return the customer codes of the agent who has the Agent code A010 in both the customer’s table and days order table (All values)
      SELECT Cust_Code, Agent_Code FROM Customer
      WHERE Agent_Code = 'A010'
      UNION ALL
      SELECT Cust_Code, Agent_Code FROM daysorder
      WHERE Agent_Code = 'A010'
      ORDER BY Cust_Code;
      
      
3.Use SQL Self join in order to match customers (A,B) from the Agent
      SELECT A.Cust_Name AS Cust_Name1, B.Cust_Name AS Cust_Name2, A.Agent_Code
      FROM Customer A, Customer B
      WHERE A.Cust_Code <> B.Cust_Code
      AND A.Agent_code = B.Agent_Code
      ORDER BY A.Agent_Code;
      
      
4.Use the SQL Full Join to select all customers and orders numbers
      SELECT Customers.Cust_Name, Orders.ORD_NUM
      FROM Customers
      FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.Cust_Name=Orders.Cust_Name
      ORDER BY Customers.Cust_Name;
//Full Outer Joins are not currently suopported on SQLite but this is the correct statement configuration
