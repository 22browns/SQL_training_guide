                                                              LEARNING

In this lesson you will learn some of the different Null Functions, as well as how to write Common Table Expressions (CTE).

*Null Functions*
Overall, there are 4 different Null Functions: IFNULL, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL.
You should have already learned IFNULL in a previous lesson.

    *IFNULL*
    IFNULL( [column], [value] )
    Eg: SELECT ItemName, IFNULL(xWeight, 0) + IFNULL(yWeight, 0);
      - IFNULL is used to tell the software what to do if an element of a table is NULL. (NULL means that the element is empty. There is no data in that slot.)
          - It is a necessary function to know because if you attempt to make a calculation but an element is NULL, the entire expression will be returned as NULL.
      - In some cases this may be OK, but in other situations you would still want the calculation to be done.
         - In MYSQL, use {IFNULL} or {COALESCE}. In SQL Server use {ISNULL}. In Oracle use {NVL}. - The formatting   ______( [column], [value] )   stays the same for all.
  
    *IS NULL*
    WHERE [column] IS NULL
     - IS NULL is used to determine if an element of a table has a 'NULL' value. 
     - NULL means that there is no data within the cell.
         - One important note is that if you have a Varchar of '', that does not count as a NULL value because the element technically is storing information. 
     - In the final lesson you will learn how to conduct data validation and this function is very useful in that scenario
         - If you want to make sure that there are no empty data points, you can use the IS NULL function to search for those slots of the table.
      
    *IS NOT NULL*
    WHERE [column] IS NOT NULL
      - Just like the IS NULL function, IS NOT NULL is used to find any elements that do NOT have a NULL value. 
      
*Common Table Expressions (CTE)*

1.Find all the customers who have null values for their payment amount



2.Find all the customers who donâ€™t have null values for their payment amount



3.Select the customers names and their grade multiplied by the addition of the opening payment and payment amount (Grade x (opening amount + payment amount)). If the payment value is null, replace it with zero and do the calculation. 



4.Delete all the duplicate customer values using cte and partition by
