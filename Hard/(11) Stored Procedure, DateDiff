In this lesson you will learn to easily rerun lines of code, and determine the amount of time between two different dates.

*Stored Procedure*
CREATE PROCEDURE [procedure name / alias]
AS
[SQL Query]
GO;
  - A Stored Procedure is used to save a the syntax for a particular query so that it can be rerun at a later time without rewriting the query.
  - The alias is what you will use at the later time to call the stored query.
  - In order to call the Procedure when needed, use an EXECUTE statement as such:
  
           EXEC [procedure name];
           
  - Another functionality of Stored Procedures is to include adjustable parameters of a WHERE statement when you call the query.
  - The following is what that syntax would look like.
  
          CREATE PROCEDURE [procedure name / alias] @[var] [datatype]
          AS
          SELECT [columns] FROM [table] WHERE [column] = @var
          GO;
          
          EXEC [procedure name] @[var] = [value];
          
   - There is a lot of information there, so here is an example of the syntax when used on the Customers table.
   
          CREATE PROCEDURE SelectCity @City nvarchar(30)
          AS
          SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
          GO;
          
          EXEC SelectCity @City = 'New York';
          
    - Basically, these parameters are used to increase the adaptivity and funcitionality of a stored procedure so that it can be modified to fit
      the query in question.

*DateDiff*
DATEDIFF( [start date] , [end date] );
  - The DateDiff clause is used to determine the amount of time between two different dates.
