In this lesson you will learn to easily rerun lines of code, and determine the amount of time between two different dates.

*Stored Procedure*
CREATE PROCEDURE [procedure name / alias]
AS
[SQL Query]
GO;
  - A Stored Procedure is used to save a the syntax for a particular query so that it can be rerun at a later time without rewriting the query.
  - The alias is what you will use at the later time to call the stored query.
  - In order to call the Procedure when needed, use an EXECUTE statement as such:
  
           EXEC [procedure name];
           
  - Another functionality of Stored Procedures is to include adjustable parameters of a WHERE statement when you call the query.
  - The following is what that syntax would look like.
  
          CREATE PROCEDURE [procedure name / alias] @[var] [datatype]
          AS
          SELECT [columns] FROM [table] WHERE [column] = @var
          GO;
          
          EXEC [procedure name] @[var] = [value];
          
   - There is a lot of new information, so here is an example of the syntax when used on the Customers table.
   
          CREATE PROCEDURE SelectCity @City nvarchar(30)
          AS
          SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
          GO;
          
          EXEC SelectCity @City = 'New York';
          
    - Basically, these parameters are used to increase the adaptivity and funcitionality of a stored procedure so that it can be modified to fit
      the query in question.
    - Instead of having to rewrite the query to change the city, you can just use an @ parameter to easily change the WHERE clause
    - There can be multiple parameters in the same Stored Procedure.

*DateDiff*
DATEDIFF( [start date] , [end date] );
  - The DateDiff clause is used to determine the amount of time between two different dates. 
  - Depending on which SQL software you are using (SQLite, MYSQL, etc.) the syntax for this command differs.

                                                              LEARNING

1.Create a procedure that will find the total balance of each agents customers



2.Calculate the difference between account opening date and order date for customer ‘C00001’ and if the difference is less than a month label it a success and if it is over a month label it fail



3.Create a running total for the orders table to see the total revenue that has been made after each order
