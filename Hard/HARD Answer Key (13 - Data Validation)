1.Find all customers that do not have a working area and set it equal to the customers city
      SELECT * from customer WHERE working_area = NULL
      SET WORKING_AREA = CUST_CITY  


2.Identify the orders that are accidental repeats and delete them from the CUSTOMER table (In this case identify copies based on repeated names)
      SELECT CUST_CODE, CUST_NAME, Count(CUST_CODE) AS Quantity FROM Customer
      GROUP BY CUST_NAME
      HAVING Quantity > 1;

      DELETE FROM Customer
      WHERE CUST_CODE = 'C00026' OR CUST_CODE = 'C00027';


3.Identify the repeated data entry in the ORDERS table that has the same information in every category and delete it
      SELECT ORD_NUM, CUST_CODE FROM orders
      GROUP BY CUST_CODE
      HAVING COUNT(id) > 1
      DELETE FROM Orders
      WHERE ORD_NUM = 200136
