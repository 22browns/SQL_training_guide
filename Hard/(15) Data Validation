In this lesson you will learn how to utilize different functions to validate data.

*Data Validation*
  - At this point in the lesson plan, you have learned almost all of the key SQL functions used for analyzing data.
  - However, your SQL skills and analysis could be perfect, but you will never get useful results if your dataset is incorrect.
  - This is where data validation comes in. Using functions that you already know, you can run queries to locate
    pieces of data that are potentially incorrect in the database.
  - Once those data points are located, it is up to you to correct the data points so that analysis of the data can begin.
  - In this lesson, you will learn 3 statements that are important in validating data. They are not the only functions that you will have to use
    validating data in the real world, but the rest of those functions have already been covered in the lesson plan!
