1.Find all customers that do not have a working area and set it equal to the customers city
      SELECT * from customer WHERE working_area = NULL
      SET WORKING_AREA = CUST_CITY  


2.Identify the orders that are accidental repeats and delete them from the CUSTOMER table (In this case identify copies based on repeated names)
      SELECT CUST_CODE, CUST_NAME, Count(CUST_CODE) as Quantity from Customer
      Group by CUST_NAME
      HAVING Quantity > 1;

      Delete from Customer
      Where CUST_CODE = 'C00026' or CUST_CODE = 'C00027';


3.Identify the repeated data entry in the ORDERS table that has the same information in every category and delete it
      SELECT ORD_NUM, CUST_CODE from orders
      Group by CUST_CODE
      HAVING Count(id) > 1
      Delete from Orders
      Where ORD_NUM = 200136
