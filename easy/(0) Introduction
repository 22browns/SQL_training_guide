Welcome to the SQL training program. 
In this 15 part program, you will learn many of the basic and advanced skills that are necessary to becoming proficient in SQL.

Before you start, there are a few things that should be established.

CAPITILIZATION RULES
  - SQL is a non-case-dependent coding language. In other words, it does not matter if you start commands with a capital or lowercase letter
  - If you have prior coding experience, it may seem unnatural, but both of these statements are valid, and will execute perfectly
      Select * from Agents where commission > 1000;
      sElEcT * FRoM aGENts wheRe CoMmIsSiOn > 1000;
  - However, there are best practices to capitilization in SQL, so it is important to establish those best practices as quick as possible so others can read your code!
  
  - Rule 1: Any overarching command (called a statement) should be in all caps. Statements are basically the keywords of SQL.
    The first few statements you will learn are SELECT, FROM, WHERE, AND, OR, NOT
  - Rule 2: Any reference to a table should be written in UpperCamelCase
  - Rule 3: Any reference to a specific column with a table should also be written in UpperCamelCase
  
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
  - A 'record' is what we call a row/line of data. One record = One row. i.e a table with 5 rows has 5 records
  - A 'query' is one chunk of code. SQL is used to search for information within a database, and queries are what are used to ask those questions. 
    A query is best defined as the culmination of the combination of statements to ask a specific question.
