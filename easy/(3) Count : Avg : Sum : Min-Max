For this lesson, you will learn how to do some qick calculations using 'Count', 'Avg' and 'Sum' as well as find the minimum and maximum values in a dataset.

                                                              LEARNING

*Count*
Count [column name]
Eg: Count distinct(CUST_CITY)
  - Count statement is used to count up the amount of entries there are within a certain column. It will return the value of the counting in place of the count statement
  - Therefore, it can be used as part of a calculation, or can just be displayed as part of the query.
  - Especially useful when paired with a distinct statement
    - If you take a look at the example, it will display the number of distinct cities that the spy agency has customers in.
    
*Sum*
Sum [column name] 
Eg: Sum paid
  - Unlike a count statement, a sum statement goes through each data entry and adds the values within them up.
  - Just like a count statement, this value is returned to the location of the command that it is typed, so it can be used as a part of a calculation, or just displayed as a part of the query.
  - When attempting to use the sum command, make sure that you have a proper data type for the column you are adding in. If a numeric is entered in as a non-numeric datatype,
    (eg: '123' entered as a varchar datatype) the sum command will not work; however, if you would still like to add data with the wrong datatype, reference the 'Cast' command 
    located in future lessons.

*Avg*
Avg([colum_name])
Eg: Avg(commission)
  - The average function 'avg' will output the average value of a set of data. 
  - It finds the average by performing a sum and a count simultaneously, and then dividing the sum by the count. 
  

*Min/Max*
Select Min([column name]) from [table name]
Eg: Select Min(commission) from Agents
  - The Min and Max commands will locate the minimum or maximum value in a set of data, and then select that piece of data.
  - If there are multiple rows that have the same minimum value, it will not display the minimum multiple times. Rather, it will determine what that value is,
    and display it one time. 

                                                              PROBLEMS

1. Calculate the average commission of all of the agents.



2. Sum the commissions of all the agents that have an “e” in their name.



3. Count the number of agents that have a commission above the average. Select count(agent_code) from Agents.



4. Find the smallest and largest agent code (Run two separate statements.



5. Find the largest Agent Code that earns a commission below the average
