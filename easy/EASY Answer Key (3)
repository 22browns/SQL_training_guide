1.Calculate the average commission of all of the agents
      SELECT AVG(commission) FROM Agents;
      
      
2.Sum the commissions of all the agents that have an “e” in their name
      SELECT SUM(commission) FROM Agents
      WHERE agent_name LIKE “%e%”;
      
      
3.Count the number of agents that have a commission above the average
      SELECT COUNT(agent_code) FROM Agents
      WHERE commission > (SELECT AVG(commission) FROM Agents);
      
      
4.Find the smallest and largest agent code (Run two separate statements)
	    SELECT MIN(agent_code) FROM Agents;
//Seperate statements
	    SELECT MAX(agent_code) FROM Agents;
      
      
5.Find the largest Agent Code that earns a commission below the average
      SELECT MAX(Agent_Code) FROM Agents
      WHERE commission < (SELECT AVG(commission) FROM agents);
