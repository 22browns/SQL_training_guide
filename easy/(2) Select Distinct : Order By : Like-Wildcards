For this lesson, you will learn how to use a 'select distinct' statement, order output with 'order by', and compare numerics with a 'like statement.

                                                              LEARNING

*Select Distinct*
Select Distinct [column name] from [table]
Eg: Select Distinct Agent_Code from Customers
  - Select Distinct is used to select and output values that are not duplicates
  - For the columns that you identify, it will take out any and all duplicate values, and display what is left
  - Take a look at the example (eg). Lets say that you only have access to a table of customers, each customer being associated with a working agent. 
    You could use Select Distinct to get a list of all agents without needing the Agents table.
    
*Order by*
Order by [column name] [asc/desc]
Eg: Order by cust_name asc
  - Order by is used to sort data into order according to the specifications that you give
  - Asc stand for 'ascending' and will sort the data in ascending order. In the example, customer names will be put in alphabetical order.
  - Desc stands for 'descending' and will sort the data in descending order. If you swap the asc for desc in the example, it will do reverse alphabetical order.
  - You can order a table by multiple columns (order by column_1, column_2 [asc/desc]) If you do this, it will first order the rows by the first table.
    Once this is done, if there are multiple rows with the same value in column 1, it will adjust the order according to column 2.
    SHOW AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
    
*Like and Wildcards*
Where [column name] like [value]
Eg: Where name like 'H%'
  - A like statement is used in place of a comparator in a mathematical expression (<,>,=)
  - Must put your phrase within single quotes
  - % symbol is a wildcard that is used to represent ‘anything’
  - In other words, any amount of characters with any different sequence of those characters can appear after 2017 in the fromDate for it to be selected
    This includes no characters at all
  - In the example, any row that has a from date that begins with ‘2017’ will be selected
  - You can place multiple percent symbols like such ‘%2017%’ and this means that as long as 2017 appears somewhere within the fromDate, that row will 
    be selected

                                                             PROBLEMS

1. Select everything from the customer's table and Order the first names of all of the customers in ascending alphabetical order



2. Create a list of working areas that contain an “o” somewhere in the middle (Cannot be first or last letter). Do not output any repeats



3. Find all the customer codes that are greater than 9 where the second to last number is not a 0 and order them in descending order.



4. Create a list of all of the agent codes that do not have a “1” in their name and order that list in descending order
