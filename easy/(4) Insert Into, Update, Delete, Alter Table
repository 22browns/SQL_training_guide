Insert Into, Update, Delete, Alter Table
For this lesson, you will learn how to 

*Insert Into*
INSERT INTO [table] ([column1], [column2], [column3], ...)
VALUES ([value1], [value2], [value3], ...)
  - Insert into is used to add new records (rows of data) into an existing table.
  - This statement is what was used to create the tables on the franchise.cloud.app website
  - If you are using an INSERT INTO statement and have values for each column of your table, the column names are not necessary
      INSERT INTO [table]
      VALUES ([value1], [value2], [value3], ...)
      
*Update*
UPDATE [table] 
SET [column name] = [value1], [column name] = [value2],...
WHERE [expression];
  - UPDATE is used to change existing records within a table
  - Think of this as a 'find and replace' feature in word documents. THe code will identify all instances of a certain value, and change it to whatever you would like.
  - Make sure that you include a where clause. If you omit it, you will change the entire column to be that value.
  - There is no 'undo' feature in SQL, so it might be a good idea to backup your table/database before attempting to update the data.
  
*Delete*
DELETE FROM [table]
WHERE [expression];
  - DELETE is used to remove records (rows of data) from the table.
  - Like the UPDATE statement, you must caution yourself. If you do not have a where clause, everything will be deleted form the table.
      - The table will still exist, but have no records within it.
      
*Alter Table*
ALTER TABLE [table]
[ADD/DROP COLUMN/ALTER] [column] [datatype];
  - ALTER TABLE is used to either add, delete, or alter columns within a table.
  - ADD will add a column of the specified datatype to the tail end of the table. Once added, you can insert values.
  - DROP COLUMN will remove the entire column that you specified. With a drop statement you do not include a datatype indicator.
      - ALTER TABLE [table] DROP COLUMN [column];
  - ALTER COLUMN can be used to change which kind of datatype the column can store.
      - If there are no records in your table, you can convert between any two datatypes.
      - If there are already records, the two datatypes you are converting between must be compatible, otherwise you will get a conversion error.
  - Feel free to go back to the '(0) Introduction' file to see a list of all datatypes.
