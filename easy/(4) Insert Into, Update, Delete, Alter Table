Insert Into, Update, Delete, Alter Table
For this lesson, you will learn how to 

*Insert Into*
INSERT INTO [table] ([column1], [column2], [column3], ...)
VALUES ([value1], [value2], [value3], ...)
  - Insert into is used to add new records (rows of data) into an existing table.
  - This statement is what was used to create the tables on the franchise.cloud.app website
  - If you are using an INSERT INTO statement and have values for each column of your table, the column names are not necessary
      INSERT INTO [table]
      VALUES ([value1], [value2], [value3], ...)
      
*Update*


  - UPDATE is used to change existing records within a table
