For the first lesson, you will learn how to use and write a select statement, sort through data with a 'where' statement, as well as write multiple where statements by utilizing an 'and', 'or' or 'not' statement.

                                                              LEARNING
                                                              
*SELECT*
SELECT [column names]  FROM  [table]
Eg: SELECT * FROM agents
  - Select is a statement that tells the computer that you want to access a table
  - * means “Everything”. This means that you want to view all of the contents of a given table
  - The asterik can be replaced with specific column names of a table if you only want to view those. If there are multiple column names you would like to select, but not all
    of them, use commas to seperate out the columns like so: SELECT Age, Name, Address FROM Customers;

*WHERE*
WHERE [expression]
Eg: WHERE age < 30
  - Where statement gives a parameter to limit the amount of results that appear
  - The expression you are testing is going to be a simple mathematical expression with two numerics and an operator
  
    OPERATORS:(greater than [>] less than [<] equal [=] not equal [!= or <>] greater than or equal [>=] less than or equal [<=] 
              *There are also the 'between', 'in' and 'like' operators, but you will learn about those later on.
              
  - In the example, SQL will only output a row of data if the age is less than 30
  - A where statement must be preceeded by a select statement (eg: select * from agents where age > 30)

*AND/OR/NOT*
WHERE [expression] [AND, OR, NOT] [expression]
Eg: WHERE age < 30 AND salary > 100000
  - And, or, or not statements are used to combine 'where' statements so that there are multiple parameters that are being tested
  - AND means that both parameters must be true for the row of data to pass
  - OR means that at least 1 parameter must be true for the row of data to pass
  - NOT specifies that the expression that follows it can not be true, while the previous expression must be true
      Make note of the following: (Where age > 30 NOT gender = 'male') is the same thing as writing (Where age > 30 AND gender != 'male')
      Both of those statements will find all individuals who are older than 30 and not male

                                                             PROBLEMS

1. For the following problems we will be utilizing the 'Agents' table. Make sure you have this table uploaded into your own browser.



2. Select all values from the ‘Agents’ table.



3. Select all of the agents that make a commission of ‘0.15’.



4. Select the names of the agents that work out of Bangalore.



5. Select the Agent code and Phone number of the agents who work out of London OR Bangalore.



6. Select the Agent Code of the agents who earn a commission of 0.11, but are not named ‘Mukesh'.


*Once you are done solving all problems visit the 'EASY Answer Key' File to see the best way to solve each problem. If you're answer is different than
what is written, remember that there are always multiple solutions to a problem. Compare the outputs of each solution, and compare methods. If you 
believe that your answer is more efficient, great! Otherwise, consider adjusting your methods and SQL habits to match that of the answer key.
