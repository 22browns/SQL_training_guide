For this lesson you will learn two more operators for having multiple where statements in a single query. 

                                                              LEARNING

*In*
Where [column name] IN ([value1], [value 2], ...);
Eg: Where ORD_AMOUNT IN (1000,2000,3000);
  - An 'IN' statement is used to wrtie multiple 'OR' statements quickly
      - Same thing as writing { Where [column] = [value1] OR [column] = [value2] ......}
  - This statement will select each record (row of data) where the specified column matches any one of the values within the parentheses
  - Within the parentheses you can also nest a select statement 
      - Select * from Agents 
        Where AGENT_CODE IN (Select AGENT_CODE from Orders Where ORD_AMOUNT > 4000)
      - This example Will provide the information of all of the agents who have completed an order greater than $4000 dollars. 
      
*Between*
Where [column] BETWEEN [value1] and [value2];
Eg: Where CustomerID BETWEEN 5 and 14;
    - Between statements are used to indicate a range of values that you wish to select 
    - These statements are inclustiory of the maximum and minimum values that you indicated
        - Think of it as a 'greater than or equal' and 'less than or equal' sign  ------>  5 <= x <= 14
    - Between statements can be applied to more than numeric values. If you place words in the place of numbers, it will find all values that are
      between the two indicated words alphabetically
    - Placing a 'NOT' statement before 'BETWEEN' i.e 'NOT BETWEEN' will find all values outside of the indicated range
