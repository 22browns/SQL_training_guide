1. Select everything from the customer's table and Order the first names of all of the customers in ascending alphabetical order
      SELECT * FROM customer 
      ORDER BY CUST_NAME asc;
      
      
2. Create a list of working areas that contain an “o” somewhere in the middle (Cannot be first or last letter). Do not output any repeats
      SELECT DISTINCT(working_area) FROM customer
      WHERE working_area LIKE ‘_%o%_’;
      
      
3. Find all the customer codes that are greater than 9 (where the second to last number is not a 0) and order them in descending order.
      SELECT cust_code FROM customer
      WHERE cust_code NOT LIKE ‘%0_’ ;
      
      
4. Create a list of all of the agent codes that do not have a “1” in their name and order that list in descending order
      SELECT DISTINCT(agent_code) FROM customer 
      WHERE agent_code NOT LIKE ‘%1%’
      ORDER BY agent_code desc;
